act_rankings
=============
This is the codebase for managing the annual fencer rankings for the ACT Fencing Association.

It's not particularly pretty, and lots of the policy settings are hardcoded, although a the points details have made their way into assets/points_table.php.

It uses the CodeIgnighter framework and the GroceryCRUD plugin.
